# Doing Web Dev Simplified's 'Learn React With This One Project'

### Kyle says this mini React.js project will help illustrate what React is all about.

### This will give an nice compact overview of React.js and provide a nice bedrock foundation for when I start Colt Steele's React.js course.

_We'll learn:_

- What React.js is

- How to think like a React dev

- Components

- Props

- State and useState

- useEffect

- And much more!
