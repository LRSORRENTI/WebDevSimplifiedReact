# Doing Web Dev Simplified's 'Learn React With This One Project'

### Kyle says this mini React.js project will help illustrate what React is all about.

### This will give an nice compact overview of React.js and provide a nice bedrock foundation for when I start Colt Steele's React.js course.

Actually maybe I should take a different learning approach, after this quick overview of React project, maybe I should just start building stuff I want to build and use React, Colt's course is 40 hours long, and I'm sure it's excellent, but I need to start building things of my own and I have ideas I really want to build.

Also need to learn three.js, some of those three.js sites are the coolest things I've ever seen, [jesse zhou's website](jesse-zhou.com) is a dream build, I have to make something like that one day

_We'll learn:_

- What React.js is

- How to think like a React dev

- Components

- Props

- State and useState

- useEffect

- And much more!
