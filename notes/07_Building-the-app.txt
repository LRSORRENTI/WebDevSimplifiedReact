================
Building the app
================

As you see, we have some css files, 
some asset files, we're going to delete most 
of this, and in our main.jsx we can remove the 
imported css at the top 

Then inside our App.jsx file, we're going to 
delete everything inside the main App func, and 
add our own functionality

=====================
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION
=====================

Inside react 'class' is reserved, if 
we want to add a class to jsx element, 
we instead use <form className="input-form"></form>
We need to use className instead of class 

Also important, we can only ever return one 
thing inside of a return App() func, one way 
around this is to wrap the entire html inside 
of a div, which will work

But a better way is to use a FRAGMENT, 
what is a fragment? 

Well a fragment is just an element that has no 
specified tag, it looks like this: 


export default function App(){
  return (
  <>
  <form className="add-item-form">
    <div className="row-form">
      <label htmlFor="item">My Items</label>
      <input type="text" id="item" />
    </div>
    <button className="btn">Add Item</button>
  </form>
  <h1 className="h1">My To-Do List</h1>
  </>
  )
}

So as we see, after the return keyword, we add 
a '()' to wrap the whole thing inside, then below 
use <>, with nothing inside, and at the bottom 
before the ending '()' we close the fragment </>
