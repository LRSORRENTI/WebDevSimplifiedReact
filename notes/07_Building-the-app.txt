================
Building the app
================

As you see, we have some css files, 
some asset files, we're going to delete most 
of this, and in our main.jsx we can remove the 
imported css at the top 

Then inside our App.jsx file, we're going to 
delete everything inside the main App func, and 
add our own functionality

=====================
IMPORTANT DISTINCTION
=====================

Inside react 'class' is reserved, if 
we want to add a class to jsx element, 
we instead use <form className="input-form"></form>
We need to use className instead of class
