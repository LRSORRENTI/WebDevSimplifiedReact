===================
A look at the setup
===================

Now if we look at our main index.html, at 
the bottom, below our root div, we have a script,
and the src connects to main.jsx file

And if we look at that main.jsx file we see:

import React from 'react'

// The above line imports the react module from 
// the react package, this provides the core 
// functionality for building react apps 

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client'

// The above line imports the react-dom module 
// from the react-dom client package, this provides 
// functionality for rendering react components 
// to the dom


import App from './App'

// This line is importing the 
// App module from the './App' file. 
// Assuming that the './App' file exports a 
// default React component,
// this line is effectively importing that component.


import './index.css'

 // This line is importing a CSS file, 
 // but it is not importing a module. 
 // Instead, it is importing the file
  // and applying its styles to the 
  // current module (usually the entire 
  // application).

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
)

// The above is how we actually render our app component 
// to the dom itself

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')): 

// This line is creating a new React root element
 // by calling ReactDOM.createRoot() and passing 
 // in the DOM element with ID "root" as an argument.
  // This root element is where our React application
   // will be rendered.

// .render: This is the method that
// actually renders a React element to the DOM.

// <React.StrictMode>: This is a special 
// component provided by React that helps
 // with development mode. It activates 
 // additional checks and warnings for
 // potential issues in your code.
  
  //  Wrapping your component with 
   // <React.StrictMode> does not affect
    // the production build.

<App />: 
// This is the component
 // that we are rendering 
 // to the DOM. It is the 
 // top-level component of our React application.

 Remember, with libraries like react, we dynamically 
 render our content via a root div, the html itself 
 is empty otherwise, our html, style, and functionality 
 will be rendered via this root div
