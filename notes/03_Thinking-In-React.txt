=======================
Thinking in a React way
=======================

When using React to build our UI's, we need 
to change our thought approach

It's different than the thought approach when 
building with vanilla JavaScript

When building our UI, we should always keep in 
mind what the final build will look like 

Then once we have what the final build will look 
like as a concept, we break that final concept down 
into components, a component hierarchy 

One important thing to keep in mind when breaking 
the final concept down into a component hierarchy, 
when we write our code for the components, we need 
to change our thought process for writing code 

In vanilla JavaScript applications, our code is 
imperative, meaning it goes step by step top to 
bottom

With React, the thought process should be more 
along the lines of 'I want this app to look like 
this in the end' and I want React to fill all of 
this in for me 

This is declarative programming

An analogy for imperative vs. declarative programming 
would be if we wanted to make a sandwich

The imperative approach to building a sandwich 
is to first get a list of ingredients, then 
have a list of instructions on how to combine 
said ingredients to create the final sandwich

The declarative way to building a sandwich is 
by going to a sandwich shop and saying 'I want 
a sandwich with these ingredients or toppings'

These are the two different approaches, imperative is 
how I get to the end result sandwich, declarative is 
saying this is the kind of sandwich I want 

That's the mindset and thought approach needed 
to write React code, the final part of this project 
will help illustrate this concept clearly
