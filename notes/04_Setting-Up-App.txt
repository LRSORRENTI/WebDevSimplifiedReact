==================
Setting up the app
==================

Step 1. Inside of project folder run the following 
command: npm create vite@latest, which will create 
a vite app 

Step 2. Fill in the project name in the command line
prompt, type a '.' to name the project after the 
current directory name 

Step 3. Scroll down to React in the command line 
and hit enter, then scroll down to JavaScript 
+ SWC, SWC stands for speedy web compiler, this is 
a faster alternative to babel that can transpile 
modern into EcmaScript 5, which can be used in most 
browsers 

Step 4. Run 'npm i' to install all necessary dependencies 

Step 5. Run 'npm run dev' this will start our application 
and give us a localhost where it's being ran, ctrl click 
to open in the browser and we see the vite template 
running along side the React logo

After running our commands, we see we have a lot of 
files in our directory, a vite.config.js where we 
can alter the config for vite 

package.json with scripts and dependencies
