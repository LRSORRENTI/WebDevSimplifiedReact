What is React?
============== 

React is a component based library for 
building front-end User Interfaces 

It allows front end UI's to be built with 
ease and extends features beyond vanilla 
HTML, CSS, and JS

In React we have things that look like 
HTML inside of JavaScript, that's JSX

React will render components to the page, 
that's the main idea behind it, it breaks 
your code into components that can be dynamically 
rendered to the page

It's a different way to build web apps, and can 
make building well functioning and visually appealing 
apps more streamline 

At it's core, React is a tool that makes creating 
front-end apps easier
